        Hey <span className="animate-pulse text-2xl">ðŸ‘‹</span> I am an aspiring
        backend developer who wants to work on building tech-first solutions to
        complex real-world problems. As a kid I loved tinkering with things that
        were broken, figuring out how they worked, and fixing them again which
        led to my interest to be an engineer. <br />I believe in learning by
        doing, competitive by nature.
